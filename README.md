# Mercury: network metadata capture and analysis
<img align="right" src="./mercury.png" width="200"> 

This package contains two programs for fingerprinting network traffic and capturing and analyzing packet metadata: **mercury**, a Linux application that leverages the modern Linux kernel's high-performance networking capabilities (AF_PACKET and TPACKETv3), which is described below, and [**pmercury**](python/README.md), a portable python application, which is described [here](python/README.md).  There is also a [User's Guide](https://github.com/cisco/mercury/wiki/Using-Mercury).

## Overview

Mercury reads network packets, identifies metadata of interest, and writes out the metadata in JSON format.  Alternatively, mercury can write out the packets that contain the metadata in the PCAP file format.  Mercury can scale up to high data rates (40Gbps on server-class hardware); it uses zero-copy ring buffers to acquire packets, and packets are processed by independent worker threads.  The amount of memory consumed by the ring buffers, and the number of worker threads, are configurable; this makes it easy to scale up (but be wary of using too much memory).  

Mercury produces fingerprint strings for TLS, DTLS, SSH, HTTP, TCP, and other protocols; these fingerprints are formed by carefully selecting and normaling metadata extracted from packets.  Fingerprint strings are reported in the "fingerprint" object in the JSON output.  Optionally, mercury can perform process identification based on those fingerprints and the destination context; these results are reported in the "analysis" object.  

## Version 2.3.4
* *Multiple* PCAP files can be piped in to the standard input, like `cat *.pcap | ./mercury`, which can simplify workflow and improve performance, especially when working with HDFS and NFS, by minimizing or eliminating the need to write intermediary files to disk.
* Added defensive coding (no changes in functionality).

## Version 2.3.3
* Improved QUIC processing.
* Added recognition of CONNECT, PUT, and HEAD methods for HTTP fingerprinting.
* Fixed a bug in the --analysis module caused when the fingerprint database contains a count field greater than 2^31.  

## Version 2.3.2
* QUIC client fingerprints are now reported.
* PCAP files can be piped in to the standard input, like `cat dhcp.pcap | ./mercury --metadata`.  This feature makes it easier to work with some environments like HDFS.
* Added [documentation](doc/schema.md) for the JSON schema output by mercury.
* New **--nonselected-tcp-data** option writes out the TCP Data field for *non*-selected traffic, as a hex string in the JSON output.  This option provides a view into the TCP data that the --select option does not recognize. The --select filter affects the data written by this option; if you want to see the TCP Data field for all traffic, then '--select=none' on the command line.
* New **--nonselected-udp-data** option, similar to the one above, but for UDP traffic.
* There was a significant refactoring that eliminated much dead code, and flattened the packet-processing code (which is now in `pkt_proc.cc`, which is where you would probably expect to find it).
* Experimental suport for [on-demand TCP reassembly](doc/odtcpr.md).
* Improvements to DNS and DHCP processing and JSON output.
* Added documentation for the [safe parsing strategy](doc/safe-parsing.md) that mercury uses for parsing packets and certificates.

## Version 2.3.0
* New **--resources** command line option causes resource files (used in analysis) to be read from a directory other than the default.  This makes it easier to use a fingerprint prevalence database other than the system default one.
* New metadata output: SSH KEX INIT message and TCP initial sequence number (that is, the SEQ of the TCP SYN packet).
* The packet processing logic has been refactored to use a more systematic approach to packet parsing, which is documented in [doc/safe-parsing](https://github.com/cisco/mercury/blob/master/doc/safe-parsing.md).  The new code is considerably easier to read and extend; it is utilized by the JSON output path, though some functions from the old lower-level approach to packet parsing is still in place in the PCAP output path.  

## Version 2.2.0
* New **--metadata** command line option causes JSON output to include a lot more metadata in its output: tls.client.version, tls.client.random, tls.client.session_id, tls.client.cipher_suites, tls.client.compression_methods, tls.client.server_name, tls.server.random, tls.server.certs, http.request.method, http.request.uri, http.request.protocol, http.request.host, and http.request.user_agent.
*  Accomodating the richer metadata required changes to the previous JSON schema.  The current schema is documented in [json-test.py](test/json-test.py).

## Version 2.1.0
* TLS certificates can optionally be output in detail as a JSON object, with the **--certs-json** command.
* Experimental: DNS responses can optionally be output in detail as a JSON object, with the **--dns-json** command.   The JSON schema used with this feature is likely to change.
* The --select (or -s) command now accepts an optional argument that specifies one or more protocols to select.  The argument --select=tls,dns causes mercury to process only TLS and DNS packets, for instance.
* Added support for VXLAN and MPLS
* Per-packet output is no longer supported

## Building and installing mercury
In the root directory, run 
```
./configure 
make
```
to build the package (and check for the programs and python modules required to test it).  TPACKETv3 is present in Linux kernels newer than 3.2.

### Installation
In the root directory, edit mercury.cfg with the network interface you want to capture from, then run 
```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
to install mercury and create and start a systemd service.  If you don't want the mercury systemd service to be installed, then instead run
```
sudo make install-nosystemd
```
The default file and directory locations are
   * __/usr/local/bin/mercury__ for the executable
   * __/usr/local/share/mercury__ for the resource files
   * __/usr/local/var/mercury__ for the output files
   * __/etc/mercury/mercury.cfg__ for the configuration file
   * __/etc/systemd/system/mercury.service__ for the systemd unit file

The output file directory is owned by the user **mercury**; this user is created by the 'make install' target, which must be run as root.  The installation prefix **/usr/local/** can be changed by running ./configure with the --prefix argument, for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.  If you want to install the program somewhere in your home directory, you probably don't want to create the user mercury; you should use the 'make install-nonroot' target, which does not create a user, does not install anything into /etc, and does not install a systemd unit.

The easiest way to run mercury in capture mode is using systemd; the OS automatically starts the mercury systemd unit after each boot, and halts it when the OS is shut down.  To check its status, run
```
systemctl status mercury
```
and the output should contain 'active (running)'.  To view the log (stderr) output from the mercury unit, run
```
sudo journalctl -u mercury
```


### Compile-time options
There are compile-time options that can tune mercury for your hardware, or generate debugging output.  Each of these options is set via a C/C++ preprocessor directive, which should be passed as an argument to "make".   For instance, to turn on debugging, first run **make clean** to remove the previous build, then run **make "OPTFLAGS=-DDEBUG"**.   This runs make, telling it to pass the string "-DDEBUG" to the C/C++ compiler.  The available compile time options are:
   * -DDEBUG, which turns on debugging, and
   * -FBUFSIZE=16384, which sets the fwrite/fread buffer to 16,384 bytes (for instance).
If multiple compile time options are used, then they must be passed to make together in the OPTFLAGS string, e.g. "OPTFLAGS=-DDEBUG -DFBUFSIZE=16384".

### DETAILS
   **[-c or --capture] c** captures packets from interface c with Linux AF_PACKET
   using a separate ring buffer for each worker thread.  **[-t or --thread] t**
   sets the number of worker threads to t, if t is a positive integer; if t is
   "cpu", then the number of threads will be set to the number of available
   processors.  **[-b or --buffer] b** sets the total size of all ring buffers to
   (b * PHYS_MEM) where b is a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 and PHYS_MEM
   is the available memory; USE b < 0.1 EXCEPT WHEN THERE ARE GIGABYTES OF SPARE
   RAM to avoid OS failure due to memory starvation.

   **[-f or --fingerprint] f** writes a JSON record for each fingerprint observed,
   which incorporates the flow key and the time of observation, into the file f.
   With **[-a or --analysis]**, fingerprints and destinations are analyzed and the
   results are included in the JSON output.

   **[-w or --write] w** writes packets to the file w, in PCAP format.  With the
   option **[-s or --select]**, packets are filtered so that only ones with
   fingerprint  metadata are written.

   **[r or --read] r** reads packets from the file r, in PCAP format.

   **[-s or --select] f** selects packets according to the metadata filter f, which
   is a comma-separated list of the following strings:
      dhcp          DHCP discover message
      dns           DNS response
      tls           DTLS clientHello, serverHello, and certificates
      http          HTTP request and response
      ssh           SSH handshake and KEX
      tcp           TCP headers
      tcp.message   TCP initial message
      tls           TLS clientHello, serverHello, and certificates
      wireguard     WG handshake initiation message
      all           all of the above
      <no option>   all of the above

   **[-u or --user] u** sets the UID and GID to those of user u, so that
   output file(s) are owned by this user.  If this option is not set, then
   the UID is set to SUDO_UID, so that privileges are dropped to those of
   the user that invoked sudo.  A system account with username mercury is
   created for use with a mercury daemon.

   **[-d or --directory] d** sets the working directory to d, so that all output
   files are written into that location.  When capturing at a high data rate, a
   high performance filesystem and disk should be used, and NFS partitions
   should be avoided.

   **--config c** reads configuration information from the file c.

   **[-a or --analysis]** performs analysis and reports results in the "analysis"
   object in the JSON records.   This option only works with the option
   [-f or --fingerprint].

   **[-l or --limit] l** rotates output files so that each file has at most
   l records or packets; filenames include a sequence number, date and time.

   **--dns-json** writes out DNS responses as a JSON object; otherwise,
   that data is output in base64 format, as a string with the key "base64".

   **--certs-json** writes out certificates as JSON objects; otherwise,
   that data is output in base64 format, as a string with the key "base64".

   **[-v or --verbose]** writes additional information to the standard error,
   including the packet count, byte count, elapsed time and processing rate, as
   well as information about threads and files.

   **--license** and **--version** write their information to stdout, then halt.

   **[-h or --help]** writes this extended help message to stdout.
   

### SYSTEM
The directories used by the default install are as follows.  Run **mercury --help** to
see if the directories on your system differ.
```
   Resource files used in analysis: /usr/local/share/mercury
   Systemd service output:          /usr/local/var/mercury
   Systemd service configuration    /etc/mercury/mercury.cfg
```

### EXAMPLES
```
   mercury -c eth0 -w foo.pcap           # capture from eth0, write to foo.pcap
   mercury -c eth0 -w foo.pcap -t cpu    # as above, with one thread per CPU
   mercury -c eth0 -w foo.mcap -t cpu -s # as above, selecting packet metadata
   mercury -r foo.mcap -f foo.json       # read foo.mcap, write fingerprints
   mercury -r foo.mcap -f foo.json -a    # as above, with fingerprint analysis
   mercury -c eth0 -t cpu -f foo.json -a # capture and analyze fingerprints
```

## Ethics
Mercury is intended for defensive network monitoring, security research and forensics.  Researchers, administrators, penetration testers, and security operations teams can use these tools to protect networks, detect vulnerabilities, and benefit the broader community through improved awareness and defensive posture. As with any packet monitoring tool, Mercury could potentially be misused. **Do not run it on any network of which you are not the owner or the administrator**.
