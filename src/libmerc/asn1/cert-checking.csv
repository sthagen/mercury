Check,Criteria,Implemented,Notes
Subject Key,RSA.modulus >= 2048,Yes,Should improve ASN::INTEGER error checking
,RSA.exponent >= 0x1001,Yes,"FIPS-140 requirement, but not universally agreed on.  Is there a way to check for OAEP?"
,EC should avoid weak alg type,Yes ,List of bad types needs review / contribution (see x509.h: is_weak())
,EC parameters need to be checked,No,
,EC public key must be on curve,No,"This is not importat for some curves, but could be applied to all"
,Key should only appear in one cert,No,This check requires a large secondary memory
,RSA key should not have duplicate factors,No,This check requires a large secondary memory
,,,
Signature Algorithm,Alg type must not be on bad list,Yes,List of bad types needs review / contribution (see x509.h: is_weak())
,Alg type = “” indicates self-signed,Yes,Certs in trust store can be self-signed; 
,,,
Signature,Signature should be checked and valid,No,"We probably don’t want to do this if we can avoid it, but it’s listed here for completeness"
,,,
Trusted / Untrusted,"Must be trusted, or on path from trusted",,Trusted store must be implemented; proposal: add a PEM file with roots into /usr/local/share/mercury/resources/
,,,
Validity Period,Should enclose current time,No,
,Age should be limited,No,
