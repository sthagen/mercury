/**
 * Encoded Parse Tree (EPT) 
 * 
 * An Encoded Parse Tree (EPT) is a general and flexible way to
 * represent a fingerprint.  It faithfully represents the
 * implementation-static data extracted from packets, using a tree of
 * byte strings that can be serialized in readable or binary form.
 * 
 * Selective packet parsing produces a parse tree whose leaves contain
 * the selected fields of the packet.  Each leaf (external node) of
 * the parse tree contains a byte string, and each internal node holds
 * an ordered list of nodes.  The tree is serialized with a preorder
 * traversal, so that the selected fields appear in the same order in
 * the serialized data as they do on the wire.  For a particular
 * fingerprint format, the position of the node in the tree determines
 * its semantics; for instance, the first leaf may be the version
 * field, and so on.  
 * 
 * Each protocol has its own fingerprint format, which specifies the
 * fields that are extracted from the packets and how they are
 * normalized.  Because protocols evolve over time, fingerprint
 * formats need to be able to evolve as well.  We define formats for
 * TLS, TCP, SSH, and DHCP.
 * 
 * The human-readable representation of an EPT uses bracket
 * expressions.  Each leaf is a hexadecimal string surrounded by
 * parentheses, such as "(474554)", and each internal node is
 * represented by a pair of balanced parenthesis that surround the
 * nodes that it holds, such as "((0000)(000b00020100))".  Bracket
 * expressions are commonly used in natural language processing, and
 * they can be easily parsed in a single pass.  The binary
 * representation of an EPT uses a simple type-length-value encoding
 * that is defined below.
 *
 * EPT is both flexible and reversible, meeting the following requirements:
 *  
 *   - It can easily accommodate changes in the fingerprint format, and
 *     can readily be applied to new protocols,
 * 
 *   - It can represent any selected fields from the fingerprint,
 *
 *   - It can support approximate fingerprint matching, so that slightly
 *     different fingerprints from slightly different applications can
 *     be matched,
 *
 *   - It avoids computationally expensive operations, such as
 *     cryptographic hashing, to facilitate use at high data rates,
 *
 *   - It provides both binary and human-readable forms.
